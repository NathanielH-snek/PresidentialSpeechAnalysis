This data will be used later. As this project was iterated over a few moths a fixed data file was downloaded and saved and will be loaded for this analysis. In order to do good text analysis, you need to first preprocess your text data. Since this data contains transcripts sometimes from television there are many unneeded symbols in the text. Regex is a tool that allows us to remove characters from strings using pattern matching. After removing this excess data there are further preprocessing steps we can do. One step is to remove stop words. These are words that are frequent and don't really have much meaning depending on what your end goal is. Another thing you can do is something call lemmatization. This is a process which essentially shortens words to their roots and allows words that are similar like do and doing to show up as identical words. This can make models simpler since you don't have as many different components. Finally when this is all done you can then tokenize text. This is when text is broken up into much smaller parts. These parts can be thought of as words although that's not necessarily what the tokens actually end up being. It's important to note that different tokenizers can process text differently.</span></span>"

Truman&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;title&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;April 16, 1945: First Speech to Congress&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;transcript&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Members of the Congress:&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nIt is with a heavy heart that I stand before you, my friends and colleagues, in the Congress of the United States.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nOnly yesterday, we laid to rest the mortal remains of our beloved President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt. At a time like this, words are inadequate. The most eloquent tribute would be a reverent silence.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nYet, in this decisive hour, when world events are moving so rapidly, our silence might be misunderstood and might give comfort to our enemies.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nIn His infinite wisdom, Almighty God has seen fit to take from us a great man who loved, and was beloved by, all humanity.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nNo man could possibly fill the tremendous void left by the passing of that noble soul. No words can ease the aching hearts of untold millions of every race, creed and color. The world knows it has lost a heroic champion of justice and freedom.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nTragic fate has thrust upon us grave responsibilities. We must carry on. Our departed leader never looked backward. He looked forward and moved forward. That is what he would want us to do. That is what America will do.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nSo much blood has already been shed for the ideals which we cherish, and for which Franklin Delano Roosevelt lived and died, that we dare not permit even a momentary pause in the hard fight for victory.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nToday, the entire world is looking to America for enlightened leadership to peace and progress. Such a leadership requires vision, courage and tolerance. It can be provided only by a united nation deeply devoted to the highest ideals.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWith great humility I call upon all Americans to help me keep our nation united in defense of those ideals which have been so eloquently proclaimed by Franklin Roosevelt.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nI want in turn to assure my fellow Americans and all of those who love peace and liberty throughout the world that I will support and defend those ideals with all my strength and all my heart. That is my duty and I shall not shirk it.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nSo that there can be no possible misunderstanding, both Germany and Japan can be certain, beyond any shadow of a doubt, that America will continue the fight for freedom until no vestige of resistance remains!&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWe are deeply conscious of the fact that much hard fighting is still ahead of us.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nHaving to pay such a heavy price to make complete victory certain, America will never become a party to any plan for partial victory!&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nTo settle for merely another temporary respite would surely jeopardize the future security of all the world.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nOur demand has been, and it remains&#92;&#92;u2014Unconditional Surrender!&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWe will not traffic with the breakers of the peace on the terms of the peace.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe responsibility for making of the peace--and it is a very grave responsibility&#92;&#92;u2014must rest with the defenders of the peace. We are not unconscious of the dictates of humanity. We do not wish to see unnecessary or unjustified suffering. But the laws of God and of man have been violated and the guilty must not go unpunished. Nothing shall shake our determination to punish the war criminals even though we must pursue them to the ends of the earth.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nLasting peace can never be secured if we permit our dangerous opponents to plot future wars with impunity at any mountain retreat&#92;&#92;u2014however distant.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nIn this shrinking world, it is futile to seek safety behind geographical barriers. Real security will be found only in law and in justice.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nHere in America, we have labored long and hard to achieve a social order worthy of our great heritage. In our time, tremendous progress has been made toward a really democratic way of life. Let me assure the forward-looking people of America that there will be no relaxation in our efforts to improve the lot of the common people.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nIn the difficult days ahead, unquestionably we shall face problems of staggering proportions. However, with the faith of our fathers in our hearts, we do not fear the future.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nOn the battlefields, we have frequently faced overwhelming odds&#92;&#92;u2014and won! At home, Americans will not be less resolute!&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWe shall never cease our struggle to preserve and maintain our American way of life.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nAt this moment, America, along with her brave Allies, is paying again a heavy price for the defense of our freedom. With characteristic energy, we are assisting in the liberation of entire nations. Gradually, the shackles of slavery are being broken by the forces of freedom.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nAll of us are praying for a speedy victory. Every day peace is delayed costs a terrible toll.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe armies of liberation today are bringing to an end Hitler&#x27;s ghastly threat to dominate the world. Tokyo rocks under the weight of our bombs.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe grand strategy of the United Nations&#x27; war has been determined&#92;&#92;u2014due in no small measure to the vision of our departed Commander in Chief. We are now carrying out our part of that strategy under the able direction of Admiral Leahy, General Marshall, Admiral King, General Arnold, General Eisenhower, Admiral Nimitz and General MacArthur.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nI want the entire world to know that this direction must and will remain&#92;&#92;u2014unchanged and unhampered!&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nOur debt to the heroic men and valiant women in the service of our country can never be repaid. They have earned our undying gratitude. America will never forget their sacrifices. Because of these sacrifices, the dawn of justice and freedom throughout the world slowly casts its gleam across the horizon.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nOur forefathers came to our rugged shores in search of religious tolerance, political freedom and economic opportunity. For those fundamental rights, they risked their lives. We well know today that such rights can be preserved only by constant vigilance, the eternal price of liberty!&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWithin an hour after I took the oath of office, I announced that the San Francisco Conference would proceed. We will face the problems of peace with the same courage that we have faced and mastered the problems of war.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nIn the memory of those who have made the supreme sacrifice&#92;&#92;u2014in the memory of our fallen President&#92;&#92;u2014we shall not fail!&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nIt is not enough to yearn for peace. We must work, and if necessary, fight for it. The task of creating a sound international organization is complicated and difficult. Yet, without such organization, the rights of man on earth cannot be protected. Machinery for the just settlement of international differences must be found. Without such machinery, the entire world will have to remain an armed camp. The world will be doomed to deadly conflict, devoid of hope for real peace.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nFortunately, people have retained hope for a durable peace. Thoughtful people have always had faith that ultimately justice must triumph. Past experience surely indicates that, without justice, an enduring peace becomes impossible.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nIn bitter despair, some people have come to believe that wars are inevitable. With tragic fatalism, they insist that wars have always been, of necessity, and of necessity wars always will be. To such defeatism, men and women of good will must not and can not yield. The outlook for humanity is not so hopeless.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nDuring the dark hours of this horrible war, entire nations were kept going by something intangible&#92;&#92;u2014hope! When warned that abject submission offered the only salvation against overwhelming power, hope showed the way to victory.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nHope has become the secret weapon of the forces of liberation!&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nAggressors could not dominate the human mind. As long as hope remains, the spirit of man will never be crushed.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nBut hope alone was not and is not sufficient to avert war. We must not only have hope but we must have faith enough to work with other peace-loving nations to maintain the peace. Hope was not enough to beat back the aggressors as long as the peace-loving nations were unwilling to come to each other&#x27;s defense. The aggressors were beaten back only when the peace-loving nations united to defend themselves.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nIf wars in the future are to be prevented the nations must be united in their determination to keep the peace under law.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nNothing is more essential to the future peace of the world than continued cooperation of the nations which had to muster the force necessary to defeat the conspiracy of the Axis powers to dominate the world.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWhile these great states have a special responsibility to enforce the peace, their responsibility is based upon the obligations resting upon all states, large and small, not to use force in international relations except in the defense of law. The responsibility of the great states is to serve and not to dominate the world.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nTo build a foundation of enduring peace we must not only work in harmony with our friends abroad, but we must have the united support of our own people.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nEven the most experienced pilot cannot bring a ship safely into harbor, unless he has the full cooperation of the crew. For the benefit of all, every individual must do his duty.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nI appeal to every American, regardless of party, race, creed, or color, to support our efforts to build a strong and lasting United Nations Organization.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nYou, the Members of the Congress, surely know how I feel. Only with your help can I hope to complete one of the greatest tasks ever assigned to a public servant. With Divine guidance, and your help, we will find the new passage to a far better world, a kindly and friendly world, with just and lasting peace.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWith confidence, I am depending upon all of you.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nTo destroy greedy tyrants with dreams of world domination, we cannot continue in successive generations to sacrifice our finest youth.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nIn the name of human decency and civilization, a more rational method of deciding national differences must and will be found!&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nAmerica must assist suffering humanity back along the path of peaceful progress. This will require time and tolerance. We shall need also an abiding faith in the people, the kind of faith and courage which Franklin Delano Roosevelt always had!&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nToday, America has become one of the most powerful forces for good on earth. We must keep it so. We have achieved a world leadership which does not depend solely upon our military and naval might.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWe have learned to fight with other nations in common defense of our freedom. We must now learn to live with other nations for our mutual good. We must learn to trade more with other nations so that there may be for our mutual advantage&#92;&#92;u2014increased production, increased employment and better standards of living throughout the world.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nMay we Americans all live up to our glorious heritage.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nIn that way, America may well lead the world to peace and prosperity.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nAt this moment, I have in my heart a prayer. As I have assumed my heavy duties, I humbly pray Almighty God, in the words of King Solomon:&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad; for who is able to judge this thy so great a people?&#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nI ask only to be a good and faithful servant of my Lord and my people.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;n&#92;&quot;},{&#92;&quot;doc_id&#92;&quot;:1,&#92;&quot;date&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;1945-05-08&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;president&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;Harry S. Truman&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;title&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;May 8, 1945: Announcing the Surrender of Germany&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;transcript&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;This is a solemn but a glorious hour. I only wish that Franklin D. Roosevelt had lived to witness this day. General Eisenhower informs me that the forces of Germany have surrendered to the United Nations. The flags of freedom fly over all Europe.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nFor this victory, we join in offering our thanks to the Providence which has guided and sustained us through the dark days of adversity.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nOur rejoicing is sobered and subdued by a supreme consciousness of the terrible price we have paid to rid the world of Hitler and his evil band. Let us not forget, my fellow Americans, the sorrow and the heartache which today abide in the homes of so many of our neighbors&#92;&#92;u2014neighbors whose most priceless possession has been rendered as a sacrifice to redeem our liberty.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWe can repay the debt which we owe to our God, to our dead and to our children only by work&#92;&#92;u2014by ceaseless devotion to the responsibilities which lie ahead of us. If I could give you a single watchword for the coming months, that word is&#92;&#92;u2014work, work, and more work.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWe must work to finish the war. Our victory is but half-won. The West is free, but the East is still in bondage to the treacherous tyranny of the Japanese. When the last Japanese division has surrendered unconditionally, then only will our fighting job be done.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWe must work to bind up the wounds of a suffering world&#92;&#92;u2014to build an abiding peace, a peace rooted in justice and in law. We can build such a peace only by hard, toilsome, painstaking work&#92;&#92;u2014by understanding and working with our allies in peace as we have in war.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe job ahead is no less important, no less urgent, no less difficult than the task which now happily is done.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nI call upon every American to stick to his post until the last battle is won. Until that day, let no man abandon his post or slacken his efforts. And now, I want to read to you my formal proclamation of this occasion:&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;A Proclamation&#92;&#92;u2014The Allied armies, through sacrifice and devotion and with God&#x27;s help, have wrung from Germany a final and unconditional surrender. The western world has been freed of the evil forces which for five years and longer have imprisoned the bodies and broken the lives of millions upon millions of free-born men. They have violated their churches, destroyed their homes, corrupted their children, and murdered their loved ones. Our Armies of Liberation have restored freedom to these suffering peoples, whose spirit and will the oppressors could never enslave.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;Much remains to be done. The victory won in the West must now be won in the East. The whole world must be cleansed of the evil from which half the world has been freed. United, the peace-loving nations have demonstrated in the West that their arms are stronger by far than the might of the dictators or the tyranny of military cliques that once called us soft and weak. The power of our peoples to defend themselves against all enemies will be proved in the Pacific war as it has been proved in Europe.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;For the triumph of spirit and of arms which we have won, and for its promise to the peoples everywhere who join us in the love of freedom, it is fitting that we, as a nation, give thanks to Almighty God, who has strengthened us and given us the victory.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;Now, therefore, I, Harry S. Truman, President of the United States of America, do hereby appoint Sunday, May 13, 1945, to be a day of prayer.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;I call upon the people of the United States, whatever their faith, to unite in offering joyful thanks to God for the victory we have won, and to pray that He will support us to the end of our present struggle and guide us into the ways of peace.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;I also call upon my countrymen to dedicate this day of prayer to the memory of those who have given their lives to make possible our victory.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.&#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;n&#92;&quot;},{&#92;&quot;doc_id&#92;&quot;:2,&#92;&quot;date&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;1945-08-06&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;president&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;Harry S. Truman&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;title&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;August 6, 1945: Statement by the President Announcing the Use of the A-Bomb at Hiroshima&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;transcript&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;Sixteen hours ago an American airplane dropped one bomb on Hiroshima, an important Japanese Army base. That bomb had more power than 20,000 tons of T.N.T. It had more than two thousand times the blast power of the British &#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;Grand Slam&#92;&#92;&#92;&quot; which is the largest bomb ever yet used in the history of warfare.&#92;&#92;nThe Japanese began the war from the air at Pearl Harbor. They have been repaid many fold. And the end is not yet. With this bomb we have now added a new and revolutionary increase in destruction to supplement the growing power of our armed forces. In their present form these bombs are now in production and even more powerful forms are in development.&#92;&#92;nIt is an atomic bomb. It is a harnessing of the basic power of the universe. The force from which the sun draws its power has been loosed against those who brought war to the Far East.&#92;&#92;nBefore 1939, it was the accepted belief of scientists that it was theoretically possible to release atomic energy. But no one knew any practical method of doing it. By 1942, however, we knew that the Germans were working feverishly to find a way to add atomic energy to the other engines of war with which they hoped to enslave the world. But they failed. We may be grateful to Providence that the Germans got the V-1&amp;#39;s and V-2&amp;#39;s late and in limited quantities and even more grateful that they did not get the atomic bomb at all.&#92;&#92;nThe battle of the laboratories held fateful risks for us as well as the battles of the air, land and sea, and we have now won the battle of the laboratories as we have won the other battles.&#92;&#92;nBeginning in 1940, before Pearl Harbor, scientific knowledge useful in war was pooled between the United States and Great Britain, and many priceless helps to our victories have come from that arrangement. Under that general policy the research on the atomic bomb was begun. With American and British scientists working together we entered the race of discovery against the Germans.&#92;&#92;nThe United States had available the large number of scientists of distinction in the many needed areas of knowledge. It had the tremendous industrial and financial resources necessary for the project and they could be devoted to it without undue impairment of other vital war work. In the United States the laboratory work and the production plants, on which a substantial start had already been made, would be out of reach of enemy bombing, while at that time Britain was exposed to constant air attack and was still threatened with the possibility of invasion. For these reasons Prime Minister Churchill and President Roosevelt agreed that it was wise to carry on the project here. We now have two great plants and many lesser works devoted to the production of atomic power. Employment during peak construction numbered 125,000 and over 65,000 individuals are even now engaged in operating the plants. Many have worked there for two and a half years. Few know what they have been producing. They see great quantities of material going in and they see nothing coming out of these plants, for the physical size of the explosive charge is exceedingly small. We have spent two billion dollars on the greatest scientific gamble in history-and won.&#92;&#92;nBut the greatest marvel is not the size of the enterprise, its secrecy, nor its cost, but the achievement of scientific brains in putting together infinitely complex pieces of knowledge held by many men in different fields of science into a workable plan. And hardly less marvelous has been the capacity of industry to design, and of labor to operate, the machines and methods to do things never done before so that the brain child of many minds came forth in physical shape and performed as it was supposed to do. Both science and industry worked under the direction of the United States Army, which achieved a unique success in managing so diverse a problem in the advancement of knowledge in an amazingly short time. It is doubtful if such another combination could be got together in the world. What has been done is the greatest achievement of organized science in history. It was done under high pressure and without failure.&#92;&#92;nWe are now prepared to obliterate more rapidly and completely every productive enterprise the Japanese have above ground in any city. We shall destroy their docks, their factories, and their communications. Let there be no mistake; we shall completely destroy Japan&amp;#39;s power to make war.&#92;&#92;nIt was to spare the Japanese people from utter destruction that the ultimatum of July 26 was issued at Potsdam. Their leaders promptly rejected that ultimatum. If they do not now accept our terms they may expect a rain of ruin from the air, the like of which has never been seen on this earth. Behind this air attack will follow sea and land forces in such numbers and power as they have not yet seen and with the fighting skill of which they are already well aware.&#92;&#92;nThe Secretary of War, who has kept in personal touch with all phases of the project, will immediately make public a statement giving further details.&#92;&#92;nHis statement will give facts concerning the sites at Oak Ridge near Knoxville, Tennessee, and at Richland near Pasco, Washington, and an installation near Santa Fe, New Mexico. Although the workers at the sites have been making materials to be used in producing the greatest destructive force in history they have not themselves been in danger beyond that of many other occupations, for the utmost care has been taken of their safety.&#92;&#92;nThe fact that we can release atomic energy ushers in a new era in man&amp;#39;s understanding of nature&amp;#39;s forces. Atomic energy may in the future supplement the power that now comes from coal, oil, and falling water, but at present it cannot be produced on a basis to compete with them commercially. Before that comes there must be a long period of intensive research.&#92;&#92;nIt has never been the habit of the scientists of this country or the policy of this Government to withhold from the world scientific knowledge. Normally, therefore, everything about the work with atomic energy would be made public.&#92;&#92;nBut under present circumstances it is not intended to divulge the technical processes of production or all the military applications, pending further examination of possible methods of protecting us and the rest of the world from the danger of sudden destruction.&#92;&#92;nI shall recommend that the Congress of the United States consider promptly the establishment of an appropriate commission to control the production and use of atomic power within the United States. I shall give further consideration and make further recommendations to the Congress as to how atomic power can become a powerful and forceful influence towards the maintenance of world peace.&#92;&quot;},{&#92;&quot;doc_id&#92;&quot;:3,&#92;&quot;date&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;1945-08-09&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;president&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;Harry S. Truman&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;title&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;August 9, 1945: Radio Report to the American People on the Potsdam Conference&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;transcript&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;My fellow Americans:&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nI have just returned from Berlin, the city from which the Germans intended to rule the world. It is a ghost city. The buildings are in ruins, its economy and its people are in ruins.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nOur party also visited what is left of Frankfurt and Darmstadt. We flew over the remains of Kassel, Magdeburg, and other devastated cities. German women and children and old men were wandering over the highways, returning to bombed-out homes or leaving bombed out cities, searching for food and shelter.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nWar has indeed come home to Germany and to the German people. It has come home in all the frightfulness with which the German leaders started and waged it.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe German people are beginning to atone for the crimes of the gangsters whom they placed in power and whom they wholeheartedly approved and obediently followed.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nWe also saw some of the terrific destruction which the war had brought to the occupied countries of Western Europe and to England.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nHow glad I am to be home again! And how grateful to Almighty God that this land of ours has been spared!&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nWe must do all we can to spare her from the ravages of any future breach of the peace. That is why, though the United States wants no territory or profit or selfish advantage out of this war, we are going to maintain the military bases necessary for the complete protection of our interests and of world peace. Bases which our military experts deem to be essential for our protection, and which are not now in our possession, we will acquire. We will acquire them by arrangements consistent with the United Nations Charter.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nNo one can foresee what another war would mean to our own cities and our own people. What we are doing to Japan now--even with the new atomic bomb--is only a small fraction of what would happen to the world in a third World War.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThat is why the United Nations are determined that there shall be no next war.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThat is why the United Nations are determined to remain united and strong. We can never permit any aggressor in the future to be clever enough to divide us or strong enough to defeat us.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThat was the guiding spirit in the conference at San Francisco.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThat was the guiding spirit in the conference of Berlin.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThat will be the guiding spirit in the peace settlements to come.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nIn the conference of Berlin, it was easy for me to get along in mutual understanding and friendship with Generalissimo Stalin, with Prime Minister Churchill, and later with Prime Minister Attlee.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nStrong foundations of good will and cooperation had been laid by President Roosevelt. And it was clear that those foundations rested upon much more than the personal friendships of three individuals. There was a fundamental accord and agreement upon the objectives ahead of us.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nTwo of the three conferees of Teheran and Yalta were missing by the end of this conference. Each of them was sorely missed. Each had done his work toward winning this war. Each had made a great contribution toward establishing and maintaining a lasting world peace. Each of them seems to have been ordained to lead his country in its hour of greatest need. And so thoroughly had they done their jobs that we were able to carry on and to reach many agreements essential to the future peace and security of the world.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe results of the Berlin conference have been published. There were no secret agreements or commitments--apart from current military arrangements.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nAnd it was made perfectly plain to my colleagues at the conference that, under our Constitution, the President has no power to make any treaties without ratification by the Senate of the United States.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nI want to express my thanks for the excellent services which were rendered at this conference by Secretary of State Byrnes, and which were highly commended by the leaders of the other two powers. am thankful also to the other members of the American delegation-Admiral Leahy and Ambassadors Harriman, Davies, and Pauley--and to the entire American staff. Without their hard work and sound advice the conference would have been unable to accomplish as much as it did.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe conference was concerned with many political and economic questions. But there was one strictly military matter uppermost in the minds of the American delegates. It was the winning of the war against Japan. On our program, that was the most important item.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe military arrangements made at Berlin were of course secret. One of those secrets was revealed yesterday, when the Soviet Union declared war on Japan.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe Soviet Union, before she had been informed of our new weapon, agreed to enter the war in the Pacific. We gladly welcome into this struggle against the last of the Axis aggressors our gallant and victorious ally against the Nazis.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe Japs will soon learn some more of the other military secrets agreed upon at Berlin. They will learn them firsthand--and they will not like them.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nBefore we met at Berlin, the United States Government had sent to the Soviet and British Governments our ideas of what should be taken up at the conference. At the first meeting our delegation submitted these proposals for discussion. Subjects were added by the Soviet and British Governments, but in the main the conference was occupied with the American proposals.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nOur first nonmilitary agreement in Berlin was the establishment of the Council of Foreign Ministers.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe Council is going to be the continuous meeting ground of the five principal governments, on which to reach common understanding regarding the peace settlements. This does not mean that the five governments are going to try to dictate to, or dominate, other nations. It will be their duty to apply, so far as possible, the fundamental principles of justice underlying the Charter adopted at San Francisco.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nJust as the meeting at Dumbarton Oaks drew up the proposals to be placed before the conference at San Francisco, so this Council of Foreign Ministers will lay the groundwork for future peace settlements. This preparation by the Council will make possible speedier, more orderly, more efficient, and more cooperative peace settlements than could otherwise be obtained.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nOne of the first tasks of the Council of Foreign Ministers is to draft proposed treaties of peace with former enemy countries--Italy, Rumania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThese treaties, of course, will have to be passed upon by all the nations concerned. In our own country the Senate will have to ratify them. But we shall begin at once the necessary preparatory work. Adequate study now may avoid the planting of the seeds of future wars.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nI am sure that the American people will agree with me that this Council of Foreign Ministers will be effective in hastening the day of peace and reconstruction.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nWe are anxious to settle the future of Italy first among the former enemy countries. Italy was the first to break away from the Axis. She helped materially in the final defeat of Germany. She has now joined us in the war against Japan. She is making real progress toward democracy.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nA peace treaty with a democratic Italian government will make it possible for us to receive Italy as a member of the United Nations.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe Council of Foreign Ministers will also have to start the preparatory work for a German peace settlement. But its final acceptance will have to wait until Germany has developed a government with which a peace treaty can be made. In the meantime, the conference of Berlin laid down the specific political and economic principles under which Germany will be governed by the occupying powers.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThose principles have been published. I hope that all of you will read them.1&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;n1See Item 91.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThey seek to rid Germany of the forces which have made her so long feared and hated, and which have now brought her to complete disaster. They are intended to eliminate Nazisre, armaments, war industries, the German General Staff and all its military tradition. They seek to rebuild democracy by control of German education, by reorganizing local government and the judiciary, by encouraging free speech, free press, freedom of religion, and the right of labor to organize.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nGerman industry is to be decentralized in order to do away with concentration of economic power in cartels and monopolies. Chief emphasis is to be on agriculture and peaceful industry. German economic power to make war is to be eliminated. The Germans are not to have a higher standard of living than their former victims, the people of the defeated and occupied countries of Europe.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nWe are going to do what we can to make Germany over into a decent nation, so that it may eventually work its way from the economic chaos it has brought upon itself, back into a place in the civilized world.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe economic action taken against Germany at the Berlin conference included another most important item--reparations.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nWe do not intend again to make the mistake of exacting reparations in money and then lending Germany the money with which to pay. Reparations this time are to be paid in physical assets from those resources of Germany which are not required for her peacetime subsistence.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe first purpose of reparations is to take out of Germany everything with which she can prepare for another war. Its second purpose is to help the devastated countries to bring about their own recovery by means of the equipment and material taken from Germany.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nAt the Crimea conference a basis for fixing reparations had been proposed for initial discussion and study by the Reparations Commission. That basis was a total amount of reparations of twenty billions of dollars. Of this sum, one half was to go to Russia, which had suffered more heavily in the loss of life and property than any other country.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nBut at Berlin the idea of attempting to fix a dollar value on the property to be removed from Germany was dropped. To fix a dollar value on the share of each nation would be a sort of guarantee of the amount each nation would get--a guarantee which might not be fulfilled.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nTherefore, it was decided to divide the property by percentages of the total amount available. We still generally agreed that Russia should get approximately half of the total for herself and Poland, and that the remainder should be divided among all the other nations entitled to reparations.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nUnder our agreement at Berlin, the reparations claims of the Soviet Union and Poland are to be met from the property located in the zone of Germany occupied by the Soviet Union, and from the German assets in Bulgaria, Finland, Hungary, Rumania and East Austria. The reparations claims of all the other countries are to be met from property located in the western zones of occupation in Germany, and from the German assets in all other countries. The Soviet waives all claim to gold captured by the Allied troops in Germany.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThis formula of taking reparations by zones will lead to less friction among the Allies than the tentative basis originally proposed for study at Yalta.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe difficulty with this formula, however, is that the industrial capital equipment not necessary for German peace economy is not evenly divided among the zones of occupation. The western zones have a much higher percentage than the eastern zone, which is mostly devoted to agriculture and to the production of raw materials. In order to equalize the distribution and to give Russia and Poland their fair share of approximately 50 percent, it was decided that they should receive, without any reimbursement, 10 percent of the capital equipment in the western zones available for reparations.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nAs you will note from the communique, a further 15 percent of the capital equipment in the western zones not necessary for Germany&amp;#39;s peace economy is also to be turned over to Russia and Poland. But this is not free. For this property, Poland and Russia will give to the western zones an equal amount in value in food, coal, and other raw materials. This 15 percent, therefore, is not additional reparations for Russia and Poland. It is a means of maintaining a balanced economy in Germany and providing the usual exchange of goods between the eastern part and the western part.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nIt was agreed at Berlin that the payment of reparations, from whatever zones taken, should always leave enough resources to enable the German people to subsist without sustained support from other nations.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe question of Poland was a most difficult one. Certain compromises about Poland had already been agreed upon at the Crimea conference. They obviously were binding upon us at Berlin.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nBy the time of the Berlin conference, the Polish Provisional Government of National Unity had already been formed; and it had been recognized by all of us. The new Polish Government had agreed to hold free and unfettered elections as soon as possible, on the basis of universal suffrage and the secret ballot.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nIn acceptance--in accordance with the Crimea agreement, we did seek the opinion of the Polish Provisional Government of National Unity with respect to its western and northern boundaries.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThey agreed, as did we all, that the final determination of the borders could not be accomplished at Berlin, but must await the peace settlement. However, a considerable portion of what was the Russian zone of occupation in Germany was turned over to Poland at the Berlin conference for administrative purposes until the final determination of the peace settlement.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nNearly every international agreement has in it the element of compromise. The agreement on Poland is no exception. No one nation can expect to get everything that it wants. It is a question of give and take--of being willing to meet your neighbor half-way.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nIn this instance, there is much to justify the action taken. The agreement on some line--even provisionally--was necessary to enable the new Poland to organize itself, and to permit the speedier withdrawal of the armed forces which had liberated her from the Germans. In the area east of the Curzon line there are over 3,000,000 Poles who are to be returned to Poland. They need room, room to settle. The new area in the West was formerly populated by Germans. But most of them have already left in the face of the invading Soviet Army. We were informed that there were only about a million and a half left.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe territory the Poles are to administer will enable Poland better to support its population. It will provide a short and more easily defensible frontier between Poland and Germany. Settled by Poles, it will provide a more homogeneous nation.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe Three Powers also agreed to help bring about the earliest possible return to Poland of all Poles who wish to return, including soldiers, with the assurance that they would have all the rights of other Polish citizens.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe action taken at Berlin will help carry out the basic policy of the United Nations toward Poland--to create a strong, independent, and prosperous nation with a government to be selected by the people themselves.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nIt was agreed to recommend that in the peace settlement a portion of East Prussia should be turned over to Russia. That, too, was agreed upon at Yalta. It will provide the Soviet Union, which did so much to bring about victory in Europe, with an ice-free port at the expense of Germany.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nAt Yalta it was agreed, you will recall, that the three governments would assume a common responsibility in helping to reestablish in the liberated and satellite nations of Europe governments broadly representative of democratic elements in the population. That responsibility still stands. We all recognize it as a joint responsibility of the three governments.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nIt was reaffirmed in the Berlin Declarations on Rumania, Bulgaria, and Hungary. These nations are not to be spheres of influence of any one power. They are now governed by Allied control commissions composed of representatives of the three governments which met at Yalta and Berlin. These control commissions, it is true, have not been functioning completely to our satisfaction; but improved procedures were agreed upon at Berlin. Until these states are reestablished as members of the international family, they are the joint concern of all of us.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe American delegation was much disturbed over the inability of the representatives of a free press to get information out of the former German satellite nations. The three governments agreed at Berlin that the Allied press would enjoy full freedom from now on to report to the world upon all developments in Rumania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland. The same agreement was reaffirmed also as to Poland.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nOne of the persistent causes for wars in Europe in the last two centuries has been the selfish control of the waterways of Europe. I mean the Danube, the Black Sea Straits, the Rhine, the Kiel Canal, and all the inland waterways of Europe which border upon two or more states.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe United States proposed at Berlin that there be free and unrestricted navigation of these inland waterways. We think this is important to the future peace and security of the world. We proposed that regulations for such navigation be provided by international authorities.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe function of the agencies would be to develop the use of the waterways and assure equal treatment on them for all nations. Membership on the agencies would include the United States, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and France, plus those states which border on the waterways.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nOur proposal was considered by the conference and was referred to the Council of Ministers. There, the United States intends to press for its adoption.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nAny man who sees Europe now must realize that victory in a great war is not something you win once and for all, like victory in a ball game. Victory in a great war is something that must be won and kept won. It can be lost after you have won it--if you are careless or negligent or indifferent.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nEurope today is hungry. I am not talking about Germans. I am talking about the people of the countries which were overrun and devastated by the Germans, and particularly about the people of Western Europe. Many of them lack clothes and fuel and tools and shelter and raw materials. They lack the means to restore their cities and their factories.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nAs the winter comes on, the distress will increase. Unless we do what we can to help, we may lose next winter what we won at such terrible cost last spring. Desperate men are liable to destroy the structure of their society to find in the wreckage some substitute for hope. If we let Europe go cold and hungry, we may lose some of the foundations of order on which the hope for worldwide peace must rest.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nWe must help to the limits of our strength. And we will.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nOur meeting at Berlin was the first meeting of the great Allies since victory was won in Europe. Naturally our thoughts now turn to the day of victory in Japan.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe British, Chinese, and United States Governments have given the Japanese people adequate warning of what is in store for them. We have laid down the general terms on which they can surrender. Our warning went unheeded; our terms were rejected. Since then the Japanese have seen what our atomic bomb can do. They can foresee what it will do in the future.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe world will note that the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, a military base. That was because we wished in this first attack to avoid, insofar as possible, the killing of civilians. But that attack is only a warning of things to come. If Japan does not surrender, bombs will have to be dropped on her war industries and, unfortunately, thousands of civilian lives will be lost. I urge Japanese civilians to leave industrial cities immediately, and save themselves from destruction.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nI realize the tragic significance of the atomic bomb.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nIts production and its use were not lightly undertaken by this Government. But we knew that our enemies were on the search for it. We know now how close they were to finding it. And we knew the disaster which would come to this Nation, and to all peace-loving nations, to all civilization, if they had found it first.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThat is why we felt compelled to undertake the long and uncertain and costly labor of discovery and production.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nWe won the race of discovery against the Germans.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nHaving found the bomb we have used it. We have used it against those who attacked us without warning at Pearl Harbor, against those who have starved and beaten and executed American prisoners of war, against those who have abandoned all pretense of obeying international laws of warfare. We have used it in order to shorten the agony of war, in order to save the lives of thousands and thousands of young Americans.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nWe shall continue to use it until we completely destroy Japan&amp;#39;s power to make war. Only a Japanese surrender will stop us.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe atomic bomb is too dangerous to be loose in a lawless world. That is why Great Britain, Canada, and the United States, who have the secret of its production, do not intend to reveal that secret until means have been found to control the bomb so as to protect ourselves and the rest of the world from the danger of total destruction.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nAs far back as last May, Secretary of War Stimson, at my suggestion, appointed a committee upon which Secretary of State Byrnes served as my personal representative, to prepare plans for the future control of this bomb. I shall ask the Congress to cooperate to the end that its production and use be controlled, and that its power be made an overwhelming influence towards world peace.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nWe must constitute ourselves trustees of this new force--to prevent its misuse, and to turn it into the channels of service to mankind.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nIt is an awful responsibility which has come to us.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nWe thank God that it has come to us, instead of to our enemies; and we pray that He may guide us to use it in His ways and for His purposes.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nOur victory in Europe was more than a victory of arms.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nIt was a victory of one way of life over another. It was a victory of an ideal founded on the rights of the common man, on the dignity of the human being, on the conception of the State as the servant--and not the master--of its people.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nA free people showed that it was able to defeat professional soldiers whose only moral arms were obedience and the worship of force.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nWe tell ourselves that we have emerged from this war the most powerful nation in the world--the most powerful nation, perhaps, in all history. That is true, but not in the sense some of us believe it to be true.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe war has shown us that we have tremendous resources to make all the materials for war. It has shown us that we have skillful workers and managers and able generals, and a brave people capable of bearing arms.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nAll these things we knew before.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe new thing--the thing which we had not known--the thing we have learned now and should never forget, is this: that a society of self-governing men is more powerful, more enduring, more creative than any other kind of society, however disciplined, however centralized.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nWe know now that the basic proposition of the worth and dignity of man is not a sentimental aspiration or a vain hope or a piece of rhetoric. It is the strongest, most creative force now present in this world.&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nNow let us use that force and all our resources and all our skills in the great cause of a just and lasting peace!&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;nThe Three Great Powers are now more closely than ever bound together in determination to achieve that kind of peace. From Teheran, and the Crimea, from San Francisco and Berlin--we shall continue to march together to a lasting peace and a happy world!&#92;&quot;},{&#92;&quot;doc_id&#92;&quot;:4,&#92;&quot;date&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;1945-09-01&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;president&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;Harry S. Truman&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;title&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;September 1, 1945: Announcing the Surrender of Japan&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;transcript&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;The thoughts and hopes of all America&#92;&#92;u2014indeed of all the civilized world&#92;&#92;u2014are centered tonight on the battleship Missouri. There on that small piece of American soil anchored in Tokyo Harbor the Japanese have just officially laid down their arms. They have signed terms of unconditional surrender.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nFour years ago, the thoughts and fears of the whole civilized world were centered on another piece of American soil&#92;&#92;u2014Pearl Harbor. The mighty threat to civilization which began there is now laid at rest. It was a long road to Tokyo&#92;&#92;u2014and a bloody one.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWe shall not forget Pearl Harbor.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe Japanese militarists will not forget the U.S.S. Missouri.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe evil done by the Japanese war lords can never be repaired or forgotten. But their power to destroy and kill has been taken from them. Their armies and what is left of their Navy are now impotent.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nTo all of us there comes first a sense of gratitude to Almighty God who sustained us and our Allies in the dark days of grave danger, who made us to grow from weakness into the strongest fighting force in history, and who has now seen us overcome the forces of tyranny that sought to destroy His civilization.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nGod grant that in our pride of the hour, we may not forget the hard tasks that are still before us; that we may approach these with the same courage, zeal, and patience with which we faced the trials and problems of the past four years.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nOur first thoughts, of course&#92;&#92;u2014thoughts of gratefulness and deep obligation&#92;&#92;u2014go out to those of our loved ones who have been killed or maimed in this terrible war. On land and sea and in the air, American men and women have given their lives so that this day of ultimate victory might come and assure the survival of a civilized world. No victory can make good their loss.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWe think of those whom death in this war has hurt, taking from them fathers, husbands, sons, brothers, and sisters whom they loved. No victory can bring back the faces they longed to see.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nOnly the knowledge that the victory, which these sacrifices have made possible, will be wisely used, can give them any comfort. It is our responsibility&#92;&#92;u2014ours, the living&#92;&#92;u2014to see to it that this victory shall be a monument worthy of the dead who died to win it.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWe think of all the millions of men and women in our armed forces and merchant marine all over the world who, after years of sacrifice and hardship and peril, have been spared by Providence from harm.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWe think of all the men and women and children who during these years have carried on at home, in lonesomeness and anxiety and fear.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nOur thoughts go out to the millions of American workers and businessmen, to our farmers and miners&#92;&#92;u2014to all those who have built up this country&#x27;s fighting strength, and who have shipped to our Allies the means to resist and overcome the enemy.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nOur thoughts go out to our civil servants and to the thousands of Americans who, at personal sacrifice, have come to serve in our Government during these trying years; to the members of the Selective Service boards and ration boards; to the civilian defense and Red Cross workers; to the men and women in the USO and in the entertainment world&#92;&#92;u2014to all those who have helped in this cooperative struggle to preserve liberty and decency in the world.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWe think of our departed gallant leader, Franklin D. Roosevelt, defender of democracy, architect of world peace and cooperation.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nAnd our thoughts go out to our gallant Allies in this war: to those who resisted the invaders; to those who were not strong enough to hold out, but who, nevertheless, kept the fires of resistance alive within the souls of their people; to those who stood up against great odds and held the line, until the United Nations together were able to supply the arms and the men with which to overcome the forces of evil.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThis is a victory of more than arms alone. This is a victory of liberty over tyranny.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nFrom our war plants rolled the tanks and planes which blasted their way to the heart of our enemies; from our shipyards sprang the ships which bridged all the oceans of the world for our weapons and supplies; from our farms came the food and fiber for our armies and navies and for our Allies in all the corners of the earth; from our mines and factories came the raw materials and the finished products which gave us the equipment to overcome our enemies.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nBut back of it all were the will and spirit and determination of a free people&#92;&#92;u2014who know what freedom is, and who know that it is worth whatever price they had to pay to preserve it.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nIt was the spirit of liberty which gave us our armed strength and which made our men invincible in battle. We now know that that spirit of liberty, the freedom of the individual, and the personal dignity of man, are the strongest and toughest and most enduring forces in all the world.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nAnd so on V-J Day we take renewed faith and pride in our own way of life. We have had our day of rejoicing over this victory. We have had our day of prayer and devotion. Now let us set aside V-J Day as one of renewed consecration to the principles which have made us the strongest nation on earth and which, in this war, we have striven so mightily to preserve.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThose principles provide the faith, the hope, and the opportunity which help men to improve themselves and their lot. Liberty does not make all men perfect nor all society secure. But it has provided more solid progress and happiness and decency for more people than any other philosophy of government in history. And this day has shown again that it provides the greatest strength and the greatest power which man has ever reached.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWe know that under it we can meet the hard problems of peace which have come upon us. A free people with free Allies, who can develop an atomic bomb, can use the same skill and energy and determination to overcome all the difficulties ahead.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nVictory always has its burdens and its responsibilities as well as its rejoicing.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nBut we face the future and all its dangers with great confidence and great hope. America can build for itself a future of employment and security. Together with the United Nations, it can build a world of peace rounded on justice, fair dealing, and tolerance.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nAs President of the United States, I proclaim Sunday, September the second, 1945, to be V-J Day&#92;&#92;u2014the day of formal surrender by Japan. It is not yet the day for the formal proclamation of the end of the war nor of the cessation of hostilities. But it is a day which we Americans shall always remember as a day of retribution&#92;&#92;u2014as we remember that other day, the day of infamy.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nFrom this day we move forward. We move toward a new era of security at home. With the other United Nations we move toward a new and better world of cooperation, of peace and international good will and cooperation.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nGod&#x27;s help has brought us to this day of victory. With His help we will attain that peace and prosperity for ourselves and all the world in the years ahead.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;n&#92;&quot;},{&#92;&quot;doc_id&#92;&quot;:5,&#92;&quot;date&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;1945-10-27&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;president&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;Harry S. Truman&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;title&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;October 27, 1945: Navy Day Address&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;transcript&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;Mayor La Guardia, ladies and gentlemen:&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nI am grateful for the magnificent reception which you have given me today in this great city of New York. I know that it is given me only as the representative of the gallant men and women of our naval forces, and on their behalf, as well as my own, I thank you.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nNew York joins the rest of the Nation in paying honor and tribute to the four million fighting Americans of the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard&#92;&#92;u2014and to the ships which carried them to victory.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nOn opposite sides of the world, across two oceans, our Navy opened a highway for the armies and air forces of the United States. They landed our gallant men, millions of them, on the beachheads of final triumph. Fighting from Murmansk, the English Channel and the Tyrrhenian Sea, to Midway, Guadalcanal, Leyte Gulf and Okinawa&#92;&#92;u2014they won the greatest naval victories in history. Together with their brothers in arms in the Army and Air Force, and with the men of the Merchant Marine, they have helped to win for mankind all over the world a new opportunity to live in peace and dignity&#92;&#92;u2014and we hope, in security.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nIn the harbor and rivers of New York City and in other ports along the coasts and rivers of the country, ships of that mighty United States Navy are at anchor. I hope that you and the people everywhere will visit them and their crews, seeing for yourselves what your sons and daughters, your labor and your money, have fashioned into an invincible weapon of liberty.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe fleet, on V-J Day, consisted of 1200 warships, more than 50,000 supporting and landing craft, and over 40,000 navy planes. By that day, ours was a sea power never before equalled in the history of the world. There were great carrier task forces capable of tracking down and sinking the enemy&#x27;s fleets, beating down his air power, and pouring destruction on his war-making industries. There were submarines which roamed the seas, invading the enemy&#x27;s own ports, and destroying his shipping in all the oceans. There were amphibious forces capable of landing soldiers on beaches from Normandy to the Philippines. There were great battleships and cruisers which swept the enemy ships from the seas and bombarded his shore defense almost at will.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nAnd history will never forget that great leader who, from his first day in office, fought to reestablish a strong American Navy&#92;&#92;u2014who watched that Navy and all the other might of this Nation grow into an invincible force for victory&#92;&#92;u2014who sought to make that force an instrument for a just and lasting peace&#92;&#92;u2014and who gave his life in the effort&#92;&#92;u2014Franklin D. Roosevelt.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe roll call of the battles of this fleet reads like a sign post around the globe&#92;&#92;u2014on the road to final victory: North Africa, Sicily, Italy, Normandy, and Southern France; the Coral Sea, Midway, Guadalcanal, and the Solomons; Tarawa, Saipan, Guam, the Philippine Sea, Leyte Gulf; Iwo Jima and Okinawa. Nothing which the enemy held on any coast was safe from its attack.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nNow we are in the process of demobilizing our naval force. We are laying up ships. We are breaking up aircraft squadrons. We are rolling up bases, and releasing officers and men. But when our demobilization is all finished as planned, the United States will still be the greatest naval power on earth.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nIn addition to that naval power, we shall still have one of the most powerful air forces in the world. And just the other day, so that on short notice we could mobilize a powerful and well-equipped land, sea, and air force, I asked the Congress to adopt universal training.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWhy do we seek to preserve this powerful Naval and Air Force, and establish this strong Army reserve? Why do we need to do that?&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWe have assured the world time and again&#92;&#92;u2014and I repeat it now&#92;&#92;u2014that we do not seek for ourselves one inch of territory in any place in the world. Outside of the right to establish necessary bases for our own protection, we look for nothing which belongs to any other power.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWe do need this kind of armed might, however, for four principal tasks:&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nFirst, our Army, Navy, and Air Force, in collaboration with our allies, must enforce the terms of peace imposed upon our defeated enemies.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nSecond, we must fulfill the military obligations which we are undertaking as a member of the United Nations Organization&#92;&#92;u2014to support a lasting peace, by force if necessary.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThird, we must cooperate with other American nations to preserve the territorial integrity and the political independence of the nations of the Western Hemisphere.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nFourth, in this troubled and uncertain world, our military forces must be adequate to discharge the fundamental mission laid upon them by the Constitution of the United States&#92;&#92;u2014to &#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;provide for the common defense&#92;&#92;&#92;&quot; of the United States.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThese four military tasks are directed not toward war&#92;&#92;u2014not toward conquest&#92;&#92;u2014but toward peace.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWe seek to use our military strength solely to preserve the peace of the world. For we now know that this is the only sure way to make our own freedom secure.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThat is the basis of the foreign policy of the people of the United States.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe foreign policy of the United States is based firmly on fundamental principles of righteousness and justice. In carrying out those principles we shall firmly adhere to what we believe to be right; and we shall not give our approval to any compromise with evil.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nBut we know that we cannot attain perfection in this world overnight. We shall not let our search for perfection obstruct our steady progress toward international cooperation. We must be prepared to fulfill our responsibilities as best we can, within the framework of our fundamental principles, even though we recognize that we have to operate in an imperfect world.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nLet me restate the fundamentals of that foreign policy of the United States:&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;n1. We seek no territorial expansion or selfish advantage. We have no plans for aggression against any other state, large or small. We have no objective which need clash with the peaceful aims of any other nation.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;n2. We believe in the eventual return of sovereign rights and self-government to all peoples who have been deprived of them by force.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;n3. We shall approve no territorial changes in any friendly part of the world unless they accord with the freely expressed wishes of the people concerned.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;n4. We believe that all peoples who are prepared for self-government should be permitted to choose their own form of government by their own freely expressed choice, without interference from any foreign source. That is true in Europe, in Asia, in Africa, as well as in the Western Hemisphere.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;n5. By the combined and cooperative action of our war allies, we shall help the defeated enemy states establish peaceful democratic governments of their own free choice. And we shall try to attain a world in which Nazism, Fascism, and military aggression cannot exist.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;n6. We shall refuse to recognize any government imposed upon any nation by the force of any foreign power. In some cases it may be impossible to prevent forceful imposition of such a government. But the United States will not recognize any such government.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;n7. We believe that all nations should have the freedom of the seas and equal rights to the navigation of boundary rivers and waterways and of rivers and waterways which pass through more than one country.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;n8. We believe that all states which are accepted in the society of nations should have access on equal terms to the trade and the raw materials of the world.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;n9. We believe that the sovereign states of the Western Hemisphere, without interference from outside the Western Hemisphere, must work together as good neighbors in the solution of their common problems.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;n10. We believe that full economic collaboration between all nations, great and small, is essential to the improvement of living conditions all over the world, and to the establishment of freedom from fear and freedom from want.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;n11. We shall continue to strive to promote freedom of expression and freedom of religion throughout the peace-loving areas of the world.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;n12. We are convinced that the preservation of peace between nations requires a United Nations Organization composed of all the peace-loving nations of the world who are willing jointly to use force if necessary to insure peace.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nNow, that is the foreign policy which guides the United States. That is the foreign policy with which it confidently faces the future.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nIt may not be put into effect tomorrow or the next day. But nonetheless, it is our policy; and we shall seek to achieve it. It may take a long time, but it is worth waiting for, and it is worth striving to attain.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe Ten Commandments themselves have not yet been universally achieved over these thousands of years. Yet we struggle constantly to achieve them, and in many ways we come closer to them each year. Though we may meet setbacks from time to time, we shall not relent in our efforts to bring the Golden Rule into the international affairs of the world.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWe are now passing through a difficult phase of international relations. Unfortunately it has always been true after past wars, that the unity among allies, forged by their common peril, has tended to wear out as the danger passed.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe world cannot afford any letdown in the united determination of the allies in this war to accomplish a lasting peace. The world cannot afford to let the cooperative spirit of the allies in this war disintegrate. The world simply cannot allow this to happen. The people in the United States, in Russia, and Britain, in France and China, in collaboration with all the other peace-loving people, must take the course of current history into their own hands and mold it in a new direction-the direction of continued cooperation. It was a common danger which united us before victory. Let it be a common hope which continues to draw us together in the years to come.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe atomic bombs which fell on Hiroshima and Nagasaki must be made a signal, not for the old process of falling apart but for a new era&#92;&#92;u2014an era of ever-closer unity and ever-closer friendship among peaceful nations.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nBuilding a peace requires as much moral stamina as waging a war. Perhaps it requires even more, because it is so laborious and painstaking and undramatic. It requires undying patience and continuous application. But it can give us, if we stay with it, the greatest reward that there is in the whole field of human effort.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nDifferences of the kind that exist today among nations that fought together so long and so valiantly for victory are not hopeless or irreconcilable. There are no conflicts of interest among the victorious powers so deeply rooted that they cannot be resolved. But their solution will require a combination of forbearance and firmness. It will require a steadfast adherence to the high principles which we have enunciated. It will also require a willingness to find a common ground as to the methods of applying those principles.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nOur American policy is a policy of friendly partnership with all peaceful nations, and of full support for the United Nations Organization. It is a policy that has the strong backing of the American people. It is a policy around which we can rally without fear or misgiving.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe more widely and clearly that policy is understood abroad, the better and surer will be the peace. For our own part we must seek to understand the special problems of other nations. We must seek to understand their own legitimate urge toward security as they see it.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe immediate, the greatest threat to us is the threat of disillusionment, the danger of insidious skepticism&#92;&#92;u2014a loss of faith in the effectiveness of international cooperation. Such a loss of faith would be dangerous at any time. In an atomic age it would be nothing short of disastrous.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThere has been talk about the atomic bomb scrapping all navies, armies, and air forces. For the present, I think that such talk is 100 percent wrong. Today, control of the seas rests in the fleets of the United States and her allies. There is no substitute for them. We have learned the bitter lesson that the weakness of this great Republic invites men of ill-will to shake the very foundations of civilization all over the world. And we had two concrete lessons in that.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWhat the distant future of the atomic research will bring to the fleet which we honor today, no one can foretell. But the fundamental mission of the Navy has not changed. Control of our sea approaches and of the skies above them is still the key to our freedom and to our ability to help enforce the peace of the world. No enemy will ever strike us directly except across the sea. We cannot reach out to help stop and defeat an aggressor without crossing the sea. Therefore, the Navy, armed with whatever weapons science brings forth, is still dedicated to its historic task: control of the ocean approaches to our country and of the skies above them.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe atomic bomb does not alter the basic foreign policy of the United States. It makes the development and application of our policy more urgent than we could have dreamed 6 months ago. It means that we must be prepared to approach international problems with greater speed, with greater determination, with greater ingenuity, in order to meet a situation for which there is no precedent.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWe must find the answer to the problems created by the release of atomic energy&#92;&#92;u2014we must find the answers to the many other problems of peace&#92;&#92;u2014in partnership with all the peoples of the United Nations. For their stake in world peace is as great as our own.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nAs I said in my message to the Congress, discussion of the atomic bomb with Great Britain and Canada and later with other nations cannot wait upon the formal organization of the United Nations. These discussions, looking toward a free exchange of fundamental scientific information, will be begun in the near future. But I emphasize again, as I have before, that these discussions will not be concerned with the processes of manufacturing the atomic bomb or any other instruments of war.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nIn our possession of this weapon, as in our possession of other new weapons, there is no threat to any nation. The world, which has seen the United States in two great recent wars, knows that full well. The possession in our hands of this new power of destruction we regard as a sacred trust. Because of our love of peace, the thoughtful people of the world know that that trust will not be violated, that it will be faithfully executed.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nIndeed, the highest hope of the American people is that world cooperation for peace will soon reach such a state of perfection that atomic methods of destruction can be definitely and effectively outlawed forever.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWe have sought, and we will continue to seek, the attainment of that objective. We shall pursue that course with all the wisdom, patience, and determination that the God of Peace can bestow upon a people who are trying to follow in His path.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;n&#92;&quot;},{&#92;&quot;doc_id&#92;&quot;:6,&#92;&quot;date&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;1947-03-12&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;president&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;Harry S. Truman&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;title&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;March 12, 1947: Truman Doctrine&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;transcript&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the Congress of the United States:&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe gravity of the situation which confronts the world today necessitates my appearance before a joint session of the Congress.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe foreign policy and the national security of this country are involved.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nOne aspect of the present situation, which I present to you at this time for your consideration and decision, concerns Greece and Turkey.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe United States has received from the Greek Government an urgent appeal for financial and economic assistance. Preliminary reports from the American Economic Mission now in Greece and reports from the American Ambassador in Greece corroborate the statement of the Greek Government that assistance is imperative if Greece is to survive as a free nation.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nI do not believe that the American people and the Congress wish to turn a deaf ear to the appeal of the Greek Government.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nGreece is not a rich country. Lack of sufficient natural resources has always forced the Greek people to work hard to make both ends meet. Since 1940, this industrious, peace loving country has suffered invasion, four years of cruel enemy occupation, and bitter internal strife.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWhen forces of liberation entered Greece they found that the retreating Germans had destroyed virtually all the railways, roads, port facilities, communications, and merchant marine. More than a thousand villages had been burned. Eighty-five percent of the children were tubercular. Livestock, poultry, and draft animals had almost disappeared. Inflation had wiped out practically all savings.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nAs a result of these tragic conditions, a militant minority, exploiting human want and misery, was able to create political chaos which, until now, has made economic recovery impossible.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nGreece is today without funds to finance the importation of those goods which are essential to bare subsistence. Under these circumstances the people of Greece cannot make progress in solving their problems of reconstruction. Greece is in desperate need of financial and economic assistance to enable it to resume purchases of food, clothing, fuel and seeds. These are indispensable for the subsistence of its people and are obtainable only from abroad. Greece must have help to import the goods necessary to restore internal order and security so essential for economic and political recovery.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe Greek Government has also asked for the assistance of experienced American administrators, economists and technicians to insure that the financial and other aid given to Greece shall be used effectively in creating a stable and self-sustaining economy and in improving its public administration.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe very existence of the Greek state is today threatened by the terrorist activities of several thousand armed men, led by Communists, who defy the government&#x27;s authority at a number of points, particularly along the northern boundaries. A Commission appointed by the United Nations Security Council is at present investigating disturbed conditions in northern Greece and alleged border violations along the frontier between Greece on the one hand and Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia on the other.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nMeanwhile, the Greek Government is unable to cope with the situation. The Greek army is small and poorly equipped. It needs supplies and equipment if it is to restore authority to the government throughout Greek territory.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nGreece must have assistance if it is to become a self-supporting and self-respecting democracy.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe United States must supply this assistance. We have already extended to Greece certain types of relief and economic aid but these are inadequate.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThere is no other country to which democratic Greece can turn.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nNo other nation is willing and able to provide the necessary support for a democratic Greek government.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe British Government, which has been helping Greece, can give no further financial or economic aid after March 31. Great Britain finds itself under the necessity of reducing or liquidating its commitments in several parts of the world, including Greece.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWe have considered how the United Nations might assist in this crisis. But the situation is an urgent one requiring immediate action, and the United Nations and its related organizations are not in a position to extend help of the kind that is required.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nIt is important to note that the Greek Government has asked for our aid in utilizing effectively the financial and other assistance we may give to Greece, and in improving its public administration. It is of the utmost importance that we supervise the use of any funds made available to Greece, in such a manner that each dollar spent will count toward making Greece self-supporting, and will help to build an economy in which a healthy democracy can flourish.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nNo government is perfect. One of the chief virtues of a democracy, however, is that its defects are always visible and under democratic processes can be pointed out and corrected. The government of Greece is not perfect. Nevertheless it represents 85 percent of the members of the Greek Parliament who were chosen in an election last year. Foreign observers, including 692 Americans, considered this election to be a fair expression of the views of the Greek people.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe Greek Government has been operating in an atmosphere of chaos and extremism. It has made mistakes. The extension of aid by this country does not mean that the United States condones everything that the Greek Government has done or will do. We have condemned in the past, and we condemn now, extremist measures of the right or the left. We have in the past advised tolerance, and we advise tolerance now. Greece&#x27;s neighbor, Turkey, also deserves our attention.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe future of Turkey as an independent and economically sound state is clearly no less important to the freedom-loving peoples of the world than the future of Greece. The circumstances in which Turkey finds itself today are considerably different from those of Greece. Turkey has been spared the disasters that have beset Greece. And during the war, the United States and Great Britain furnished Turkey with material aid.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nNevertheless, Turkey now needs our support.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nSince the war Turkey has sought additional financial assistance from Great Britain and the United States for the purpose of effecting that modernization necessary for the maintenance of its national integrity.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThat integrity is essential to the preservation of order in the Middle East.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe British Government has informed us that, owing to its own difficulties, it can no longer extend financial or economic aid to Turkey.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nAs in the case of Greece, if Turkey is to have the assistance it needs, the United States must supply it. We are the only country able to provide that help.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nI am fully aware of the broad implications involved if the United States extends assistance to Greece and Turkey, and I shall discuss these implications with you at this time.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nOne of the primary objectives of the foreign policy of the United States is the creation of conditions in which we and other nations will be able to work out a way of life free from coercion. This was a fundamental issue in the war with Germany and Japan. Our victory was won over countries which sought to impose their will, and their way of life, upon other nations.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nTo ensure the peaceful development of nations, free from coercion, the United States has taken a leading part in establishing the United Nations. The United Nations is designed to make possible lasting freedom and independence for all its members. We shall not realize our objectives, however, unless we are willing to help free peoples to maintain their free institutions and their national integrity against aggressive movements that seek to impose upon them totalitarian regimes. This is no more than a frank recognition that totalitarian regimes imposed upon free peoples, by direct or indirect aggression, undermine the foundations of international peace and hence the security of the United States.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe peoples of a number of countries of the world have recently had totalitarian regimes forced upon them against their will. The Government of the United States has made frequent protests against coercion and intimidation, in violation of the Yalta agreement, in Poland, Rumania, and Bulgaria. I must also state that in a number of other countries there have been similar developments.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nAt the present moment in world history nearly every nation must choose between alternative ways of life. The choice is too often not a free one.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nOne way of life is based upon the will of the majority, and is distinguished by free institutions, representative government, free elections, guarantees of individual liberty, freedom of speech and religion, and freedom from political oppression.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe second way of life is based upon the will of a minority forcibly imposed upon the majority. It relies upon terror and oppression, a controlled press and radio, fixed elections, and the suppression of personal freedoms.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nI believe that it must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nI believe that we must assist free peoples to work out their own destinies in their own way.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nI believe that our help should be primarily through economic and financial aid which is essential to economic stability and orderly political processes.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe world is not static, and the status quo is not sacred. But we cannot allow changes in the status quo in violation of the Charter of the United Nations by such methods as coercion, or by such subterfuges as political infiltration. In helping free and independent nations to maintain their freedom, the United States will be giving effect to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nIt is necessary only to glance at a map to realize that the survival and integrity of the Greek nation are of grave importance in a much wider situation. If Greece should fall under the control of an armed minority, the effect upon its neighbor, Turkey, would be immediate and serious. Confusion and disorder might well spread throughout the entire Middle East.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nMoreover, the disappearance of Greece as an independent state would have a profound effect upon those countries in Europe whose peoples are struggling against great difficulties to maintain their freedoms and their independence while they repair the damages of war.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nIt would be an unspeakable tragedy if these countries, which have struggled so long against overwhelming odds, should lose that victory for which they sacrificed so much. Collapse of free institutions and loss of independence would be disastrous not only for them but for the world. Discouragement and possibly failure would quickly be the lot of neighboring peoples striving to maintain their freedom and independence.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nShould we fail to aid Greece and Turkey in this fateful hour, the effect will be far reaching to the West as well as to the East.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWe must take immediate and resolute action.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nI therefore ask the Congress to provide authority for assistance to Greece and Turkey in the amount of &#36;400,000,000 for the period ending June 30, 1948. In requesting these funds, I have taken into consideration the maximum amount of relief assistance which would be furnished to Greece out of the &#36;350,000,000 which I recently requested that the Congress authorize for the prevention of starvation and suffering in countries devastated by the war.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nIn addition to funds, I ask the Congress to authorize the detail of American civilian and military personnel to Greece and Turkey, at the request of those countries, to assist in the tasks of reconstruction, and for the purpose of supervising the use of such financial and material assistance as may be furnished. I recommend that authority also be provided for the instruction and raining of selected Greek and Turkish personnel.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nFinally, I ask that the Congress provide authority which will permit the speediest and most effective use, in terms of needed commodities, supplies, and equipment, of such funds as may be authorized.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nIf further funds, or further authority, should be needed for the purposes indicated in this message, I shall not hesitate to bring the situation before the Congress. On this subject the Executive and Legislative branches of the Government must work together.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThis is a serious course upon which we embark. I would not recommend it except that the alternative is much more serious.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe United States contributed &#36;341,000,000,000 toward winning World War II. This is an investment in world freedom and world peace.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe assistance that I am recommending for Greece and Turkey amounts to little more than 1/10 of 1 percent of this investment. It is only common sense that we should safeguard this investment and make sure that it was not in vain.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe seeds of totalitarian regimes are nurtured by misery and want. They spread and grow in the evil soil of poverty and strife. They reach their full growth when the hope of a people for a better life has died.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWe must keep that hope alive.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe free peoples of the world look to us for support in maintaining their freedoms.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nIf we falter in our leadership, we may endanger the peace of the world&#92;&#92;u2014and we shall surely endanger the welfare of this Nation.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nGreat responsibilities have been placed upon us by the swift movement of events.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nI am confident that the Congress will face these responsibilities squarely.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;n&#92;&quot;},{&#92;&quot;doc_id&#92;&quot;:7,&#92;&quot;date&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;1947-06-20&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;president&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;Harry S. Truman&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;title&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;June 20, 1947: On the Veto of the Taft-Hartley Bill&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;transcript&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;My fellow countrymen:&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nAt noon today I sent to Congress a message vetoing the Taft-Hartley labor bill. I vetoed this bill because I am convinced it is a bad bill. It is bad for labor, bad for management, and bad for the country.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nI had hoped that the Congress would send me a labor bill I could sign.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nI have said before, and I say it now, that we need legislation to correct abuses in the field of labor relations.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nLast January I made specific recommendations to the Congress as to the kind of labor legislation we should have immediately. I urged that the Congress provide for a commission, to be made up of representatives of the Congress, the public, labor and management, to study the entire field of labor management relations and to suggest what additional laws we should have.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nI believe that my proposals were accepted by the great majority of our people as fair and just.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nIf the Congress had accepted those recommendations, we would have today the basis for improved labor-management relations. I would gladly have signed a labor bill if it had taken us in the right direction of stable, peaceful labor relations&#92;&#92;u2014even though it might not have been drawn up exactly as I wished.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nI would have signed a bill with some doubtful features if, taken as a whole, it had been a good bill.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nBut the Taft-Hartley bill is a shocking piece of legislation.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nIt is unfair to the working people of this country. It clearly abuses the right, which millions of our citizens now enjoy, to join together and bargain with their employers for fair wages and fair working conditions.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nUnder no circumstances could I have signed this bill.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe restrictions that this bill places on our workers go far beyond what our people have been led to believe. This is no innocent bill.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nIt is interesting to note that on June 4, Congressman Hartley on the floor of the House of Representatives, made the following statement, and I quote: &#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;You are going to find there is more in this bill than may meet the eye.&#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThat is a revealing description of this bill by one of its authors.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThere is so much more in it than the people have been led to believe, that I am sure that very few understand what the Taft-Hartley bill would do if it should become law.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThat is why I am speaking to you tonight. I want you to know the real meaning of this bill.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWe have all been told, by its proponents, that this is a &#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;moderate&#92;&#92;&#92;&quot; bill. We have been told that the bill was &#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;harsh&#92;&#92;&#92;&quot; and &#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;drastic&#92;&#92;&#92;&quot; when it was first passed by the House of Representatives, but that the Senate had persuaded the House to drop out the harsh provisions and that the final bill&#92;&#92;u2014the bill sent to me&#92;&#92;u2014was &#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;mild&#92;&#92;&#92;&quot; and &#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;moderate.&#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nBut I found no truth in the claims that the bill sent to me was mild or moderate. I found that the basic purpose and much of the language of the original House of Representatives bill were still in the final bill. In fact, the final bill follows the provisions of the original House bill in at least 36 separate places.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWe have all been told that the Taft-Hartley bill is favorable to the wage earners of this country. It has been claimed that workers need to be saved from their own folly and that this bill would provide the means of salvation. Some people have called this bill the &#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;workers&#x27; bill of rights.&#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nLet us see what this bill really would do to our workingmen.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe bill is deliberately designed to weaken labor unions. When the sponsors of the bill claim that by weakening unions, they are giving rights back to individual workingmen, they ignore the basic reason why unions are important in our democracy. Unions exist so that laboring men can bargain with their employers on a basis of equality. Because of unions, the living standards of our working people have increased steadily until they are today the highest in the world.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nA bill which would weaken unions would undermine our national policy of collective bargaining. The Taft-Hartley bill would do just that. It would take us back in the direction of the old evils of individual bargaining. It would take the bargaining power away from the workers and give more power to management.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThis bill would even take away from our workingmen some bargaining fights which they enjoyed before the Wagner Act was passed 12 years ago.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nIf we weaken our system of collective bargaining, we weaken the position of every workingman in the country.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThis bill would again expose workers to the abuses of labor injunctions.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nIt would make unions liable for damage suits for actions which have long been considered lawful.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThis bill would treat all unions alike. Unions which have fine records, with long years of peaceful relations with management, would be hurt by this bill just as much as the few troublemakers.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe country needs legislation which will get rid of abuses. We do not need&#92;&#92;u2014and we do not want&#92;&#92;u2014legislation which will take fundamental rights away from our working people.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWe have been told that the Taft-Hartley bill is a means by which the country can be protected from nationwide strikes in vital industries. The terms of the bill do not support this claim.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nMany people are under the impression that this bill would prevent or settle a strike in the coal industry. I sincerely trust that the coal operators and the miners will soon come to an agreement on the terms of a contract and that there will be no interruption of coal mining. But if the miners and the operators do not reach agreement, and if this bill should become law, it is likely that the most that could be accomplished under the complicated procedures of the bill would be postponement of a strike from July until October.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nUnder this bill a work stoppage in the coal mines might be prevented for 80 days and then, if agreement had not been reached, the miners would be free to strike, and it would be mandatory for the President to refer the whole matter to Congress, even if Congress were not in session.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nPostponing a strike in the coal industry until the approach of winter, when our need for coal is acute, is certainly not the way to protect the Nation against the dangers of a shortage of coal.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe bill would not aid fair and early settlements of disputes in vital industries.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWe have been told, by the supporters of the Taft-Hartley bill, that it would reduce industrial strife.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nOn the contrary, I am convinced that it would increase industrial strife.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe bill would soon upset security clauses in thousands of existing agreements between labor and management. These agreements were mutually arrived at and furnish a satisfactory basis for relations between worker and employer. They provide stability in industry. With their present types of agreements outlawed by this bill, the parties would have to find a new basis for agreement. The restrictions in this bill would make the process of reaching new agreements a long and bitter one.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe bill would increase industrial strife because a number of its provisions deprive workers of legal protection of fundamental rights. They would then have no means of protecting these rights except by striking.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe bill would open up opportunities for endless law suits by employers against unions and by unions against employers. For example, it would make employers vulnerable to an immense number of law suits, since grievances, however minor, could be taken into court by dissatisfied workers.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nInsofar as employers are concerned, I predict that if this bill should become law they would regret the day that it was conceived. It is loaded with provisions that would plague and hamper management. It is filled with hidden legal traps that would take labor relations out of the plant, where they belong, and place them in the courts.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nAnother defect is that in trying to correct labor abuses the Taft-Hartley bill goes so far that it would threaten fundamental democratic freedoms. One provision undertakes to prevent political contributions and expenditures by labor organizations and corporations. This provision would forbid a union newspaper from commenting on candidates in national elections. It might well prevent an incorporated radio network from spending any money in connection with the national convention of a political party. It might even prevent the League of Women Voters&#92;&#92;u2014which is incorporated&#92;&#92;u2014from using its funds to inform its members about the record of a political candidate.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nI regard this provision of the Taft-Hartley bill as a dangerous challenge to free speech and our free press.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nOne of the basic errors of this bill is that it ignores the fact that over the years we have been making real progress in labor-management relations. We have been achieving slow but steady improvement in cooperation between employers and workers.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWe must always remember that under our free economic system management and labor are associates. They work together for their own benefit and for the benefit of the public.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe Taft-Hartley bill fails to recognize these fundamental facts. Many provisions of the bill would have the result of changing employers and workers from members of the same team to opponents on contending teams.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nI feel deep concern about what this would do to the steady progress we have made through the years.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nI fear that this type of legislation would cause the people of our country to divide into opposing groups. If conflict is created, as this bill would create it&#92;&#92;u2014if the seeds of discord are sown, as this bill would sow them&#92;&#92;u2014our unity will suffer and our strength will be impaired.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThis bill does not resemble the labor legislation which I have recommended to the Congress. The whole purpose of this bill is contrary to the sound growth of our national labor policy.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThere is still time to enact progressive, constructive legislation during the present session. We need such legislation to correct abuses and to further our advance in labor management relations.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWe seek in this country today a formula which will treat all men fairly and justly, and which will give our people security in the necessities of life.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nAs our generous American spirit prompts us to aid the world to rebuild, we must, at the same time, construct a better America in which all can share equitably in the blessings of democracy.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe Taft-Hartley bill threatens the attainment of this goal.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nFor the sake of the future of this Nation, I hope that this bill will not become law.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;n&#92;&quot;},{&#92;&quot;doc_id&#92;&quot;:8,&#92;&quot;date&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;1947-06-29&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;president&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;Harry S. Truman&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;title&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;June 29, 1947: Address before the NAACP&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;transcript&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;Mr. Chairman, Mrs. Roosevelt, Senator Morse, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen:&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nI am happy to be present at the closing session of the 38th Annual Conference of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The occasion of meeting with you here at the Lincoln Memorial affords me the opportunity to congratulate the association upon its effective work for the improvement of our democratic processes.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nI should like to talk to you briefly about civil rights and human freedom. It is my deep conviction that we have reached a turning point in the long history of our country&#x27;s efforts to guarantee freedom and equality to all our citizens. Recent events in the United States and abroad have made us realize that it is more important today than ever before to insure that all Americans enjoy these rights.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWhen I say all Americans I mean all Americans.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe civil rights laws written in the early years of our Republic, and the traditions which have been built upon them, are precious to us. Those laws were drawn up with the memory still fresh in men&#x27;s minds of the tyranny of an absentee government. They were written to protect the citizen against any possible tyrannical act by the new government in this country.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nBut we cannot be content with a civil liberties program which emphasizes only the need of protection against the possibility of tyranny by the Government. We cannot stop there.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWe must keep moving forward, with new concepts of civil rights to safeguard our heritage. The extension of civil rights today means, not protection of the people against the Government, but protection of the people by the Government.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWe must make the Federal Government a friendly, vigilant defender of the rights and equalities of all Americans. And again I mean all Americans.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nAs Americans, we believe that every man should be free to live his life as he wishes. He should be limited only by his responsibility to his fellow countrymen. If this freedom is to be more than a dream, each man must be guaranteed equality of opportunity. The only limit to an American&#x27;s achievement should be his ability, his industry, and his character. These rewards for his effort should be determined only by those truly relevant qualifies.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nOur immediate task is to remove the last remnants of the barriers which stand between millions of our citizens and their birthright. There is no justifiable reason for discrimination because of ancestry, or religion, or race, or color.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWe must not tolerate such limitations on the freedom of any of our people and on their enjoyment of basic rights which every citizen in a truly democratic society must possess.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nEvery man should have the right to a decent home, the right to an education, the right to adequate medical care, the right to a worthwhile job, the right to an equal share in making the public decisions through the ballot, and the fight to a fair trial in a fair court.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWe must insure that these rights&#92;&#92;u2014on equal terms&#92;&#92;u2014are enjoyed by every citizen.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nTo these principles I pledge my full and continued support.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nMany of our people still suffer the indignity of insult, the narrowing fear of intimidation, and, I regret to say, the threat of physical injury and mob violence. Prejudice and intolerance in which these evils are rooted still exist. The conscience of our Nation, and the legal machinery which enforces it, have not yet secured to each citizen full freedom from fear.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWe cannot wait another decade or another generation to remedy these evils. We must work, as never before, to cure them now. The aftermath of war and the desire to keep faith with our Nation&#x27;s historic principles make the need a pressing one.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe support of desperate populations of battle-ravaged countries must be won for the free way of life. We must have them as allies in our continuing struggle for the peaceful solution of the world&#x27;s problems. Freedom is not an easy lesson to teach, nor an easy cause to sell, to peoples beset by every kind of privation. They may surrender to the false security offered so temptingly by totalitarian regimes unless we can prove the superiority of democracy.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nOur case for democracy should be as strong as we can make it. It should rest on practical evidence that we have been able to put our own house in order.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nFor these compelling reasons, we can no longer afford the luxury of a leisurely attack upon prejudice and discrimination. There is much that State and local governments can do in providing positive safeguards for civil rights. But we cannot, any longer, await the growth of a will to action in the slowest State or the most backward community.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nOur National Government must show the way.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThis is a difficult and complex undertaking. Federal laws and administrative machineries must be improved and expanded. We must provide the Government with better tools to do the job. As a first step, I appointed an Advisory Committee on Civil Rights last December. Its members, fifteen distinguished private citizens, have been surveying our civil rights difficulties and needs for several months. I am confident that the product of their work will be a sensible and vigorous program for action by all of us.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWe must strive to advance civil rights wherever it lies within our power. For example, I have asked the Congress to pass legislation extending basic civil rights to the people of Guam and American Samoa so that these people can share our ideals of freedom and self-government. This step, with others which will follow, is evidence to the rest of the world of our confidence in the ability of all men to build free institutions.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe way ahead is not easy. We shall need all the wisdom, imagination and courage we can muster. We must and shall guarantee the civil rights of all our citizens. Never before has the need been so urgent for skillful and vigorous action to bring us closer to our ideal.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWe can reach the goal. When past difficulties faced our Nation we met the challenge with inspiring charters of human rights-the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Emancipation Proclamation. Today our representatives, and those of other liberty-loving countries on the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, are preparing an International Bill of Rights. We can be confident that it will be a great landmark in man&#x27;s long search for freedom since its members consist of such distinguished citizens of the world as Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWith these noble charters to guide us, and with faith in our hearts, we shall make our land a happier home for our people, a symbol of hope for all men, and a rock of security in a troubled world.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nAbraham Lincoln understood so well the ideal which you and I seek today. As this conference closes we would do well to keep in mind his words, when he said,&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;n&#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;if it shall please the Divine Being who determines the destinies of nations, we shall remain a united people, and we will, humbly seeking the Divine Guidance, make their prolonged national existence a source of new benefits to themselves and their successors, and to all classes and conditions of mankind.&#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;n&#92;&quot;},{&#92;&quot;doc_id&#92;&quot;:9,&#92;&quot;date&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;1948-07-15&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;president&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;Harry S. Truman&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;title&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;July 15, 1948: Democratic National Convention&#92;&quot;,&#92;&quot;transcript&#92;&quot;:&#92;&quot;I am sorry that the microphones are in the way, but I must leave them the way they are because I have got to be able to see what I am doing&#92;&#92;u2014as I am always able to see what I am doing.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nI can&#x27;t tell you how very much I appreciate the honor which you have just conferred upon me. I shall continue to try to deserve it.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nI accept the nomination.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nAnd I want to thank this convention for its unanimous nomination of my good friend and colleague, Senator Barkley of Kentucky. He is a great man, and a great public servant. Senator Barkley and I will win this election and make these Republicans like it&#92;&#92;u2014don&#x27;t you forget that!&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWe will do that because they are wrong and we are right, and I will prove it to you in just a few minutes.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThis convention met to express the will and reaffirm the beliefs of the Democratic Party. There have been differences of opinion, and that is the democratic way. Those differences have been settled by a majority vote, as they should be.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nNow it is time for us to get together and beat the common enemy. And that is up to you.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWe have been working together for victory in a great cause. Victory has become a habit of our party. It has been elected four times in succession, and I am convinced it will be elected a fifth time next November.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe reason is that the people know that the Democratic Party is the people&#x27;s party, and the Republican Party is the party of special interest, and it always has been and always will be.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe record of the Democratic Party is written in the accomplishments of the last 16 years. I don&#x27;t need to repeat them. They have been very ably placed before this convention by the keynote speaker, the candidate for Vice President, and by the permanent chairman.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nConfidence and security have been brought to the people by the Democratic Party. Farm income has increased from less than &#36;2 billion in 1932 to more than &#36;18 billion in 1947. Never in the world were the farmers of any republic or any kingdom or any other country as prosperous as the farmers of the United States; and if they don&#x27;t do their duty by the Democratic Party, they are the most ungrateful people in the world!&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWages and salaries in this country have increased from &#36;29 billion in 1933 to more than &#36;128 billion in 1947. That&#x27;s labor, and labor never had but one friend in politics, and that is the Democratic Party and Franklin D. Roosevelt.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nAnd I say to labor what I have said to the farmers: they are the most ungrateful people in the world if they pass the Democratic Party by this year.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe total national income has increased from less than &#36;40 billion in 1933 to &#36;203 billion in 1947, the greatest in all the history of the world. These benefits have been spread to all the people, because it is the business of the Democratic Party to see that the people get a fair share of these things.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThis last, worst 80th Congress proved just the opposite for the Republicans.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe record on foreign policy of the Democratic Party is that the United States has been turned away permanently from isolationism, and we have converted the greatest and best of the Republicans to our viewpoint on that subject.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe United States has to accept its full responsibility for leadership in international affairs. We have been the backers and the people who organized and started the United Nations, first started under that great Democratic President, Woodrow Wilson, as the League of Nations. The League was sabotaged by the Republicans in 1920. And we must see that the United Nations continues a strong and growing body, so we can have everlasting peace in the world.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWe removed trade barriers in the world, which is the best asset we can have for peace. Those trade barriers must not be put back into operation again.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWe have started the foreign aid program, which means the recovery of Europe and China, and the Far East. We instituted the program for Greece and Turkey, and I will say to you that all these things were done in a cooperative and bipartisan manner. The Foreign Relations Committees of the Senate and House were taken into the full confidence of the President in every one of these moves, and don&#x27;t let anybody tell you anything else.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nAs I have said time and time again, foreign policy should be the policy of the whole Nation and not the policy of one party or the other. Partisanship should stop at the water&#x27;s edge; and I shall continue to preach that through this whole campaign.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nI would like to say a word or two now on what I think the Republican philosophy is; and I will speak from actions and from history and from experience.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe situation in 1932 was due to the policies of the Republican Party control of the Government of the United States. The Republican Party, as I said a while ago, favors the privileged few and not the common everyday man. Ever since its inception, that party has been under the control of special privilege; and they have completely proved it in the 80th Congress. They proved it by the things they did to the people, and not for them. They proved it by the things they failed to do.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nNow, let&#x27;s look at some of them&#92;&#92;u2014just a few.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nTime and time again I recommended extension of price control before it expired June 30, 1946. I asked for that extension in September 1945, in November 1945, in a Message on the State of the Union in 1946; and that price control legislation did not come to my desk until June 30, 1946, on the day on which it was supposed to expire. And it was such a rotten bill that I couldn&#x27;t sign it. And 30 days after that, they sent me one just as bad. I had to sign it, because they quit and went home.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThey said, when OPA died, that prices would adjust themselves for the benefit of the country. They have been adjusting themselves all right! They have gone all the way off the chart in adjusting themselves, at the expense of the consumer and for the benefit of the people that hold the goods.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nI called a special session of the Congress in November 1947&#92;&#92;u2014November 17, 1947&#92;&#92;u2014and I set out a 10-point program for the welfare and benefit of this country, among other things standby controls. I got nothing. Congress has still done nothing.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nWay back 4 1/2 years ago, while I was in the Senate, we passed a housing bill in the Senate known as the Wagner-Ellender-Taft bill. It was a bill to clear the slums in the big cities and to help to erect low-rent housing. That bill, as I said, passed the Senate 4 years ago. It died in the House. That bill was reintroduced in the 80th Congress as the Taft-Ellender-Wagner bill. The name was slightly changed, but it is practically the same bill. And it passed the Senate, but it was allowed to die in the House of Representatives; and they sat on that bill, and finally forced it out of the Banking and Currency Committee, and the Rules Committee took charge, and it still is in the Rules Committee.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nBut desperate pleas from Philadelphia in that convention that met here 3 weeks ago couldn&#x27;t get that housing bill passed. They passed a bill they called a housing bill, which isn&#x27;t worth the paper it&#x27;s written on.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nIn the field of labor we needed moderate legislation to promote labor-management harmony, but Congress passed instead that so-called Taft-Hartley Act, which has disrupted labor-management relations and will cause strife and bitterness for years to come if it is not repealed, as the Democratic platform says it ought to be repealed.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nOn the Labor Department, the Republican platform of 1944 said, if they were in power, that they would build up a strong Labor Department. They have simply torn it up. Only one bureau is left that is functioning, and they cut the appropriation of that so it can hardly function.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nI recommended an increase in the minimum wage. What did I get? Nothing. Absolutely nothing.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nI suggested that the schools in this country are crowded, teachers underpaid, and that there is a shortage of teachers. One of our greatest national needs is more and better schools. I urged the Congress to provide &#36;300 million to aid the States in the present educational crisis. Congress did nothing about it. Time and again I have recommended improvements in the social security law, including extending protection to those not now covered, and increasing the amount of benefits, to reduce the eligibility age of women from 65 to 60 years. Congress studied the matter for 2 years, but couldn&#x27;t find the time to extend or increase the benefits. But they did find time to take social security benefits away from 750,000 people, and they passed that over my veto.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nI have repeatedly asked the Congress to pass a health program. The Nation suffers from lack of medical care. That situation can be remedied any time the Congress wants to act upon it.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nEverybody knows that I recommended to the Congress the civil rights program. I did that because I believed it to be my duty under the Constitution. Some of the members of my own party disagree with me violently on this matter. But they stand up and do it openly! People can tell where they stand. But the Republicans all professed to be for these measures. But Congress failed to&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nact. They had enough men to do it, they could have had cloture, they didn&#x27;t have to have a filibuster. They had enough people in that Congress that would vote for cloture.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nNow everybody likes to have low taxes, but we must reduce the national debt in times of prosperity. And when tax relief can be given, it ought to go to those who need it most, and not those who need it least, as this Republican rich man&#x27;s tax bill did when they passed it over my veto on the third try.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe first one of these was so rotten that they couldn&#x27;t even stomach it themselves. They finally did send one that was somewhat improved, but it still helps the rich and sticks a knife into the back of the poor.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nNow the Republicans came here a few weeks ago, and they wrote a platform. I hope you have all read that platform. They adopted the platform, and that platform had a lot of promises and statements of what the Republican Party is for, and what they would do if they were in power. They promised to do in that platform a lot of things I have been asking them to do that they have refused to do when they had the power.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe Republican platform cries about cruelly high prices. I have been trying to get them to do something about high prices ever since they met the first time.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nNow listen! This is equally as bad, and as cynical. The Republican platform comes out for slum clearance and low-rental housing. I have been trying to get them to pass that housing bill ever since they met the first time, and it is still resting in the Rules Committee, that bill.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe Republican platform favors educational opportunity and promotion of education. I have been trying to get Congress to do something about that ever since they came there, and that bill is at rest in the House of Representatives.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThe Republican platform is for extending and increasing social security benefits. Think of that! Increasing social security benefits! Yet when they had the opportunity, they took 750,000 off the social security rolls!&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nI wonder if they think they can fool the people of the United States with such poppycock as that!&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThere is a long list of these promises in that Republican platform. If it weren&#x27;t so late, I would tell you all about them. I have discussed a number of these failures of the Republican 80th Congress. Every one of them is important. Two of them are of major concern to nearly every American family. They failed to do anything about high prices, they failed to do anything about housing.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nMy duty as President requires that I use every means within my power to get the laws the people need on matters of such importance and urgency.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nI am therefore calling this Congress back into session July 26th.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nOn the 26th day of July, which out in Missouri we call &#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;Turnip Day,&#92;&#92;&#92;&quot; I am going to call Congress back and ask them to pass laws to halt rising prices, to meet the housing crisis&#92;&#92;u2014which they are saying they are for in their platform.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nAt the same time I shall ask them to act upon other vitally needed measures such as aid to education, which they say they are for; a national health program; civil rights legislation, which they say they are for; an increase in the minimum wage, which I doubt very much they are for; extension of the social security coverage and increased benefits, which they say they are for; funds for projects needed in our program to provide public power and cheap electricity. By indirection, this 80th Congress has tried to sabotage the power policies the United States has pursued for 14 years. That power lobby is as bad as the real estate lobby, which is sitting on the housing bill.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nI shall ask for adequate and decent laws for displaced persons in place of this anti-Semitic, anti-Catholic law which this 80th Congress passed.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nNow, my friends, if there is any reality behind that Republican platform, we ought to get some action from a short session of the 80th Congress. They can do this job in 15 days, if they want to do it. They will still have time to go out and run for office.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nThey are going to try to dodge their responsibility. They are going to drag all the red herrings they can across this campaign, but I am here to say that Senator Barkley and I are not going to let them get away with it.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nNow, what that worst 80th Congress does in this special session will be the test. The American people will not decide by listening to mere words, or by reading a mere platform. They will decide on the record, the record as it has been written. And in the record is the stark truth, that the battle lines of 1948 are the same as they were in 1932, when the Nation lay prostrate and helpless as a result of Republican misrule and inaction.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nIn 1932 we were attacking the citadel of special privilege and greed. We were fighting to drive the money changers from the temple. Today, in 1948, we are now the defenders of the stronghold of democracy and of equal opportunity, the haven of the ordinary people of this land and not of the favored classes or the powerful few. The battle cry is just the same now as it was in 1932, and I paraphrase the words of Franklin D. Roosevelt as he issued the challenge, in accepting nomination in Chicago: &#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;This is more than a political call to arms. Give me your help, not to win votes alone, but to win in this new crusade to keep America secure and safe for its own people.&#92;&#92;&#92;&quot;&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nNow my friends, with the help of God and the wholehearted push which you can put behind this campaign, we can save this country from a continuation of the 80th Congress, and from misrule from now on.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;nI must have your help. You must get in and push, and win this election. The country can&#x27;t afford another Republican Congress.&#92;&#92;r&#92;&#92;n&#92;&quot;}]&quot;' data-total-rows='497' data-total-columns='4' data-banner-text='&quot;&quot;' data-pagination='true' data-page-size='10' data-field-types='[[&quot;date&quot;, [&quot;string&quot;, &quot;object&quot;]], [&quot;president&quot;, [&quot;string&quot;, &quot;object&quot;]], [&quot;title&quot;, [&quot;string&quot;, &quot;object&quot;]], [&quot;transcript&quot;, [&quot;string&quot;, &quot;object&quot;]]]' data-show-filters='true' data-show-download='true' data-show-column-summaries='true' data-row-headers='[&quot;doc_id&quot;]' data-has-stable-row-id='false' data-lazy='false' data-preload='false'></marimo-table></marimo-ui-element>"

Plotly is excellent for this as it allows us to visualize almost all of these topics per president without overloading with data on first glance. Go ahead and explore the plot with your mouse! You can see what words make up different topics. Notice any trends or anythign interesting? Almost every president here uses some speech related to topic -1 which seems to revolve around government and legislation as general terminology. Isn't that interesting? Don't worry about the code too much for this one, plotting is always a bit messy.</span></span>"

One aspect of text is something called sentiment. This is exactly what you expect, its how postive or negative the text is. There are various ways to do this but the method we've used here is Vader. It is a dictionary based method. In simplistic terms words are assigned to a specific value that is either postive or negative and then that dictionary is mapped to your text. This can be accessed through nltk which has a vader module. This is one metric but how about some others? Well fortunately this is where textstat comes in. It is a package that allows us to calculate various agreed upon readability metrics. If you want to learn more about individual metrics check out the textstat package or look up the indiviudal metrics on wikipedia.</span></span>"

Fortunately this is where Principal Component Analysis (PCA) comes in. Scikit-learn a machine learning package allows us to do this. So what is PCA? Well it's a dimensionality reduction technique. Gee that sounds confusing what does it mean? Well think of each metric we've calculated as a dimension in space. You can imagine a central sphere and that each metric is a random line coming of that sphere. Now each actual observation or number we have for each of those arrows is how far we go in that direction to create a new point. It's just like how on a regular 2d plot you have a number for X and a number for Y which are your two dimensions. So [1,1] would be 1 in the direction or dimenions of x which is left and right and 1 in the y dimension which is up and down. Now just pretend that each one of those directions actually represents one of our metrics we've calculated. If that makes sense then you're on the way to understanding high dimensions! I'm sure you're now asking though, how do you graph that? Well fortunately there  are ways to reduce a bunch of dimension into a 2d one. To really understand PCA you need to get into a little bit of linear algebra but essentially it breaks down the data into little bits that represent as much of the data as it can. We can then use the first two bits to make a plot that will actually contain information about all of the data we calculated but in a way that we can visualize. That is what the plot below is. This plot is a called a biplot! All you need to really know to interpret it is that if you look at the red lines, those represent exacctly what they are labeled as. Now imagine for example that difficult_words is a line that extends all the way up and down from where it is now. Any of the presidents that are closer to the top of the line in this plot would be higher in the amount of difficult words they use and vice versa. Now apply that to all of the other lines and you can see what the plot is telling you. If this is confusing try thinking about each line or dimension one at a time. Let's take flesch reading ease as an example. Fortunately it aligns almost exactly with the x axis so its a bit easier to understand. Those presidents to the right such as Joe Biden, Donald Trump, have extremely easy to read speeches. Those on the left like Dwight D. Eisenhower, and John F. Kennedy are much harder to read. If you want to think about this a level higher you might notice that sentiment score and reading ease are <em>nearly</em> antiparallel which means that as one increases the other decreases in an almost 1:1 ratio. So someone who makes speeches that are highly readable also tends to have less postive speeches. Interesting huh? Unfortunately our visualization is in matplotlib this time so no intereatability.</span></span>"

Perhaps you could try to map some of these speech periods to historical periods in your mind quickly. See? Text analysis and machine learning isn't that hard!
